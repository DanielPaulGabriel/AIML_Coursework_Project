# AIML_Coursework_Project
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Project consisting of two parts
Part A: 
  1. Analyse the assigned dataset “Concrete Strength Data”. Develop a multi 
  regression model based on assigned dataset to predict the strength of concrete. 
  Demonstrate that your model can predict to some level of accuracy not less 
  than 70%.

Part B: 
1. Source for relevant images to develop image recognition model using CNN to 
recognize a minimum of four different types of Wild Animals such as: 
a. Bear 
b. Elephant 
c. Giraffe 
d. Lion 
e. Rhino 

Train the model to obtain some level of accuracy not less than 70%. 
Demonstrate model training, evaluation process and application of the model 
using external input data such as image, text or numeric data.
